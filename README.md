# CSC500-Module5
This repository contains the Python program for Module 5 of the CSC500 course. The program's first part uses nested loops to collect rainfall data and calculate the monthly average rainfall for the entire period. The second part is a book club points calculator that uses conditional logic to award points based on books purchased.
